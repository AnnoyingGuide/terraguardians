Fixed a crash that was caused when the mod tried to draw Alex's sprites.
Changed the way how custom CompanionSpritesContainer is acquired, to no longer require arguments.
Mabel will no longer be shown upside down, and screaming "Aaaaaaaaahhh!!!" when you check her info on guardian selection interface, and she haven't been met in the world yet.
