You will now only receive notification about not being able to change a setting while in-game, when changing if mod companions can spawn setting.
It's now possible for a companion to visit you on the spawn point, if they can't spawn on another npc or town npc companion, because player is nearby.
Fixed a issue where the companion visiting placement position weren't being counted correctly.
Companions will be teleported to you if you respawn.
 => The only exception is when they're fighting the Wall of Flesh.
You can now ask companions to visit you through the companions list.
 => Visiting is different from simply Calling them to your group, with different friendship level requirements, if the companion has any.
 => Asking a companion to visit you, will make them more likely to visit you on their active time (If they're nocturnal, they will appear at night. If not, at day).
 => Once a companion visits your world, they will directly tell you they arrived. You can go speak with them after that.
 => Like visiting npcs, they will leave if it gets too late (Diurnal companions leaves at night. Nocturnal companions leaves at day).
Fixed AGAIN issue where Calamity Mod was giving errors when having TerraGuardians on your world.
 => Not Terrarian companions, specifically TerraGuardians (Custom made companions).
