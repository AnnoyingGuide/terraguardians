Fixed issue where companions that mounted on player back were unable to do so.
Sardine Bounty Board reimplemented.
 => If Sardine is living on your world and has a house, he will mention about the bounty board once you speak to him.
 =>  => On 1.3 version of the mod, Sardine occasionally mentions that, and you only had access to the feature by picking the dialogue option talking about the Bounty Board.
 => For those who doesn't know about the system, Sardine will ask you to place a Sign on his house, and will update it with new bounties eventually.
 =>  => Those bounties will ask you to kill monsters in the biome the Bounty appears, to make the Bounty target itself appear.
 =>  => Upon defeating the Bounty target, you can claim a reward from Sardine.
 =>  => A bounty can only be done once per character, but the same character can still try new bounties the board displays.
 =>  => All the informations about the bounty, like target, where it appears and rewards can be checked on the sign at Sardine's house.
 => Except for the lack of bounty modifiers and Ether items, the bounty system is reimplemented as it was on 1.3 version.
Added a Debug menu to companions dialogues.
 => Obviously, the DEBUG option will only appear if you have debug mode on.
 => That will have options that:
 =>  => Will let you remove a companion from being marked as Met in the world (so you can try recruitment again).
 =>  => And a option that not only removes the companion from your character companions list, but will also do the above, removing them from the Met in the world list.
 => Those commands are more related to testing if recruitment methods works.
 Fixed a bug where companions would no longer have different behavior when they were in a dialogue with your character.
 Added NExperience Mod support.
 => Companions will now be set to the same level of the player.
 => They are still subject to level downscale too, if you're using level capper setting.
