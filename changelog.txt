You can no longer invoke grappling hooks when KO'd.
Monsters will no longer chase your character when you're knocked out cold.
Changed a bit how Knocked Out Cold works for player character:
 => You only need to hold the grappling hook key until half the time rescue timer takes.
 => After half the time of rescue time passes, a companion will spend the rest of the time rescuing your character (a message from them will appear).
 => Once the timer ends, you'll appear at the position of the companion that rescued you with your other companions.
Companions will now react upon being revived.
Fixed a bug here companions wouldn't get immunity frames after blocking an attack.
