Sardine got back his missing on woke up messages.
Companions will now try to teleport to their homes if no player is nearby them or their house while they're in transit.

Added a setting which allows you to change damage reduction by number of companions following you.
    The damage reduction isn't a multiplication based on companion count. Instead, if you have more than 1 companion following you, the reduction is the previous stacked damage reduction multiplied by percentage.
    The damage reduction also affects your character.
    This setting can be changed on mod server settings.
You can now change the leading companion from your group through the talk about other things dialogue.
Companions head on the map will no longer change scale once you pass the mouse over them.
