Fixed issue where companions that mounted on player back were unable to do so.
Sardine Bounty Board reimplemented.
 => If Sardine is living on your world and has a house, he will mention about the bounty board once you speak to him.
 =>  => On 1.3 version of the mod, Sardine occasionally mentions that, and you only had access to the feature by picking the dialogue option talking about the Bounty Board.
 => For those who doesn't know about the system, Sardine will ask you to place a Sign on his house, and will update it with new bounties eventually.
 =>  => Those bounties will ask you to kill monsters in the biome the Bounty appears, to make the Bounty target itself appear.
 =>  => Upon defeating the Bounty target, you can claim a reward from Sardine.
 =>  => A bounty can only be done once per character, but the same character can still try new bounties the board displays.
 =>  => All the informations about the bounty, like target, where it appears and rewards can be checked on the sign at Sardine's house.
 => Except for the lack of bounty modifiers and Ether items, the bounty system is reimplemented as it was on 1.3 version.
Added a Debug menu to companions dialogues.
 => Obviously, the DEBUG option will only appear if you have debug mode on.
 => That will have options that:
 =>  => Will let you remove a companion from being marked as Met in the world (so you can try recruitment again).
 =>  => And a option that not only removes the companion from your character companions list, but will also do the above, removing them from the Met in the world list.
 => Those commands are more related to testing if recruitment methods works.
Fixed a bug where companions would no longer have different behavior when they were in a dialogue with your character.
Added NExperience Mod support.
 => Companions will now be set to the same level of the player.
 => They are still subject to level downscale too, if you're using level capper setting.
The game will no longer let you know when a companion you haven't met despawns.
Fixed an issue where companions could get stuck trying to drop from a solid block, when pathfinding somewhere.
Reduced the stuck check cooldown of the companion AI, from 3 seconds, to half a second.
 => That will make companions notice way earlier when they should either resume pathing, or cancel it.
Athletics and Acrobatics skills now levels up 10 times slower.
 => As a courtesy to this change, the levels of Athletics and Acrobatics skills on your companions has been reduced by 10 times.
Not met yet companions will no longer freak out when a player they're following is either above or under them.
Companions will no longer mention who you haven't met yet.
Companion Management Interface will no longer appear when in a shop, or when managing a chest.
Added a option on the mod Server Settings to allow disabling companions brought by the mod.
 => When this option is flipped on, it will prevent companions from the mod to be starter companions, prevent their town npcs from spawning, aswell as spawners from spawning them.
 => This will not remove companions you already met from your companions list, and neither remove companions on your companion list.
 => You can only change this option on the main menu.
 => Do let me know if you bump into issues.
Brutus will now try letting you know when he appeared, and where.
 => Basically, instead of just saying to look for him near a npc, he will also say which direction from the npc he's at, so you can look for him.
 => Search for Cardinal Directions to figure out directions.
