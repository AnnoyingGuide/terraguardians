Changed how companions will check which biome they're at:
 => When following the player, their biome settings will be the same as the followed player.
 => This change will fix a issue where mod biomes had their switch flipping on and off.
Fixed an issue where companions were still receiving fall damage even when they had accessories preventing it.
 => Companions you're mounted on will still, oddily, not receive fall damage. I'll need to investigate this further.
Fixed a problem with companions aiming cursor which caused it to break, when using static projectile weapons.
You can now see your leader companion cursor when with debug mode on.
