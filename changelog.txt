Zacks pre recruit state will no longer despawn at night.
Your character will no longer remain mounted on a companion upon death.
Alex will now automatically move in after you meet him for the first time.
The Nurse can now heal companions.
    She will charge a bit more for that too.
Companions will no longer teleport to you if they have Terrified debuff.
Companions will now idle around your character, if you don't move your character for at least 30 seconds.
    Companions will not idle if they're using a furniture while the player is using one too.

    I made so companion offset and player offset are different things when sharing beds.
Luna rearrives.
Companions will now invoke summons.
Added scripts for the function of more projectile launching weapons.
    Some of them might be buggy, like the Stelar Tune.
The mod will now be more aware of the biomes surrounding the companions.
