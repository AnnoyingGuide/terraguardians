Only one companion in the group will be affected by Pack Leader Necklace effect.
 => The companion that will be affected will be the first one wearing it, from Leader companion until the last follower summoned.
 => Companions not in the group will not be affected by the item effect.
Fixed a bug where Zombie Guardian was trying underground tactics.
Fixed another bug where the Zombie Guardian was trying to revive fallen foes.
2P Mode reimplemented.
 => Just like on TerraGuardians 1.3, you need to press Start button on a second controller to start it.
 => Added some extra interface to second companion into, to let second player see current inventory slot selected and active buffs.
 => Need at least 2 controllers plugged for this to work, because Terraria snatches the first controller.
Fixed some death related issues.
Fixed an issue where having companions with you could cause npcs from mods like Spirit Mod to crash and disappear.
Fixed a issue where companions could cause certain projectiles to break.
