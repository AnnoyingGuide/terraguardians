Companions and Town NPCs dialogue typos fixed.
 => Thank ThatAnnoyingGuide for that. They're awesome.
Fixed a bug where you couldn't help a companion revive until they entered Knocked Out Cold state.
You can no longer open dialogue with a KO'd companion.
Fixed some issues where Vladimir could still try holding someone even when knocked out.
Michelle will no longer show success messages on failed move in/move out messages.
Companions now should correctly be willing to move in if you have the friendship level.
