Fixed issue with Dialogue Tweak mod not letting dialogue interface show up.
    Also let the developer know of the issue.
The game should now be aware of the companions when drawing projectiles.
    That means mods like Weapon Enchantments will now work as intended.
    Finch Staff is now safe to be used again.
