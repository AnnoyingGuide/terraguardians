[This mod is currently being remade for tModLoader 1.4, so features and companions from previous version need to reimplemented, and of course, expect bugs.]

This mod implements companion characters that you can meet during your gameplay, 
and ask them to follow you on your quest, live on your world, or whatever else they can offer.

The TerraGuardians are creatures from the Ether Realm that mysteriously begun appearing in 
your world. The reason why that's happening, you'll have to discover as I develop the mod.
Meanwhile, you can fill your companions list with new friends.

Those companions are unique characters with their own dialogues and visuals.
Each of them had their art sketched from scratch to make them unique from each other.

Even though the mod is aimed towards the TerraGuardians themselves, it also adds some 
Human companions you can have.

Do let me know if you bump into issues during the gameplay of the mod, since the mod is still under development,
and I'm trying to make Terraria think the companions are player character.
