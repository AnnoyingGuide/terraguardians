# TerraGuardians Mod
This is the tModLoader 1.4 source of TerraGuardians Mod.<br>
The great diference between this version and 1.3, is that I'm trying to make<br>
the companions extend player character stuffs, to try reducing the issues with<br>
item usages and mod recognitions.<br>
<br>
I'm rebuilding the mod from scratch, while avoiding copy/paste of codes, and trying<br>
to keep the codes still fast, to avoid slowdowns.<br>
<br>
Due to rebuilding the mod, I will need some time to reimplement stuff again,<br>
so please be patient.<br>
The mod currently has a playable alpha, which you can get the link from here: https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/1-4-test-terraguardians-terrarian-companions.81757/post-2847830 <br>
