The Castle of the Werewolf Witch is a huge place, split in different regions, like entrance, 
kitchen, garden, and other places.

The Terrarians travelling through that place should be careful of her minions, since they 
will do everything to try stopping invasors from trying to reach their mistress room.

During a room in the middle of her castle, a corridor full of barricades, the Werewolf 
Witch bodyguard will chase the Terrarian. If the Terrarian ends up caught by him, 
they will be instantly booted out of the castle.

Should the Terrarian be able to arrive at the Werewolf Witch room, she will try chasing and 
catching the Terrarian, but if she ends up hurt by the Terrarian in the middle of the fight, 
she will try to hurt them too.
