The current king of a village on the Ether Realm received an attack from the
Werewolf Witch minions, whose came to try taking the King to her castle.
The King then asks the Terrarian to invade her castle and stop her from
from sending further attacks, and so the player does.

After defeating the Werewolf Witch, she gives the Terrarian her ring as a kind 
of proof that they defeated her, which the Terrarian delivers to the King.

Upon giving the ring to the King, both the King and the Terrarian ends up 
transported to the Werewolf Witch throne room, where one of her minions imobilizes the 
Terrarian, while the Werewolf approaches the King, who fearing for his life backs away, 
awaiting for her attack, just for a kiss to end up showing the Werewolf Witch intention.

After that, the King asks the Terrarian to leave the room, and so him and the Werewolf Witch 
minion does.

Outside the room, where the Terrarian is at, a minion peeks through the door keyhole, while 
the other says that's a bad idea.
Shortly after, the Werewolf Witch bodyguard appears, and depending on wether the player was 
also interested on what was happening in the room or not, will change how the player will 
leave the castle: With a boot in the behind, or walking through the front door.
