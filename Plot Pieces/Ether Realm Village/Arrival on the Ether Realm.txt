The village on the Ether Realm has spaced houses with good flora around the village, 
with trees and benches for a homey looking place.

The current King of the castle is the heir of the previous King, who did unspokable acts 
throughout the lands.
The current King is also a nice person, but might feel threatened if the Terrarian brings 
many companions with them, making the King ask his guards to stop them from advancing further.

He also has quite a relationship with Brutus, who if he's present in the occasion, will be 
persuaded by the King to return to the Royal Army, which he will refuse, stating that he 
has a contract with the Terrarian to guard their life.
